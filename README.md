# Will I Make the Bus? 🚌⏱️

**A real-time transit decision app that answers one simple question — should you start running?**

Built with Flutter and powered by Winnipeg Transit data, *Will I Make the Bus?* helps commuters decide whether they’ll realistically catch an incoming bus based on walking time, live arrivals, and historical delay patterns.

## 🚦 The Problem

If you’ve taken transit in Winnipeg, you’ve asked this before:

> *“If I leave right now… will I actually make the bus?”*

Static schedules don’t account for:
- Walking distance
- Real-time delays
- Your personal pace
- Unreliable arrival predictions

This app turns that uncertainty into a clear **Yes / No** decision.

## 🧠 How It Works

Using your current location, the app:

1. Identifies nearby bus stops within walking range  
2. Estimates walking time using your personalized speed  
3. Pulls **real-time arrival data** from Winnipeg Transit  
4. Adjusts predictions using **historical delay trends**  
5. Compares everything and gives you a clear outcome  

**No guesswork. Just timing.**
